            <p>The map shows a visual representation of the migrant flows over three years from the Isla de Sueno towards United States and Mexico. Each point on the map represent an event registered by the US Coast Guard: a green point represent a landing point of the boat; a red point represent an interdiction of the Coast Guard in that position. The map and the linked displays with charts and statistics allow to understand the evolution of the migration during the three years.</p>
            <p>The number of boats has increased along the years. On average there are 150 more attempts with respect to the previous year. The proportion of the three types of vessels (Rustic, Raft, Go Fast) is constant. There is no evidence that a vessel type is more effective than the others. Considering the respective group of records of type <a href="#" class="RecordType">Landing</a> and <a href="#" class="RecordType">Interdiction</a>, the ratio of the three type of vessels is comparable.</p>
            <p>The effectiveness of the Coast Guard during the three years shows an interdiction every two attempts, with a success rate of around 51%. However, this performance has lowered during the years. In <a href="#" class="Year">2005</a> it was around 70%. In <a href="#" class="Year">2006</a> has lowered to 56%, and in <a href="#" class="Year">2007</a> to 42%.</p>
